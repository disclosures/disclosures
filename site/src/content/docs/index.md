## Features

- **Smooth animations** -- height transitions powered by the Web Animations API
- **Accessible by default** -- built on native `<details>`/`<summary>`, keyboard navigable, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Zero dependencies** -- pure TypeScript/JavaScript with CSS, nothing else
- **Framework-agnostic** -- works with vanilla HTML, React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- **CSS customizable** -- design tokens via custom properties, BEM class names, style variants included
